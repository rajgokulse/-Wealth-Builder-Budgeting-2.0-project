# -Wealth-Builder-Budgeting-2.0-project
This project was used to budget personal income and expenses and to plan investments for effective wealth management.
I’m currently building out Budgeting 2.0: The Wealth Builder. While Budgeting 1.0 is about historical tracking, 2.0 is about engineering future net worth.My framework focuses on three core pillars:The Net Burn Rate: Monitoring the speed of consumption.The Wealth Gap: Maximizing the surplus for investment.Future Value Projection: Using the $A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$ formula to turn monthly cash flow into a 10-year roadmap.
Stop tracking your money. Start directing it. 🚀

I’m diving into a new project called "Wealth Builder" (Budgeting 2.0).

The premise is simple: A budget shouldn't just tell you that you spent too much on coffee. It should tell you exactly when your investments will replace your paycheck.
